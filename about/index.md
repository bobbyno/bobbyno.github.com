#### I build teams, quantitative applications, and software tools that make complex systems simpler and easier to manage.

Some highlights of my nearly 20-year career include:

* Launching <a href="http://www.testedminds.com">Tested Minds</a>, a boutique quantitative application development consultancy. Clients include the Johns Hopkins Institute for Computational Medicine, Guaranteed Rate, Pearson, 8th Light, and Cognitect.

* Building a custom PaaS at <a href="http://www.outpace.com">Outpace Systems</a> based on Docker and AWS.

* Learning about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Strengths_and_Virtues">Character Strengths and Virtues</a> as the VP of Engineering at <a href="http://www.getset.com">GetSet</a>, an education startup helping college students be more successful.

* Leading a team of amazing people at DRW Trading, where I was first introduced to graph databases, network science, and complex systems.

* Learning about startups and product development while living in Beijing for 9 months as the tech lead of <a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/go-agile-release-management">Go (n√©e Cruise)</a> - a continuous integration / continuous deployment server.

* Learning the Socratic Method by teaching Object-Oriented programming bootcamps with a master, Fred George.

* Porting SES - an <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/engineering/flight_design/systems_engineering_simulator">ascent / entry engineering simulator</a> for the space shuttle - from running only on Sun Fire's to a MacBook Pro.

* Learning systems engineering at Lockheed Martin from the team that built <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Automated_Fingerprint_Identification_System">IAFIS</a> for the FBI.

* Learning the differences between presenting information and improving people's performance at the Learning Systems Institute from Ian Douglas and Scott Schaffer.

I have spoken at several international software conferences over the years including OOPSLA 2007, Agile 2007, SCNA 2009, SpeakerConf 2011, and One Dev Day 2012 in Detroit.


As a consultant and software developer, my interests are in:

* Building, managing, and exploring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems">complex systems</a>.
* Deliberate practice, apprenticeship, and growing great teams over time.
* System development in Clojure, R, Matlab, Ruby, and Java.
* Polyglot persistence, esp. solving network / graph problems using a relational / graph DB hybrid.
* Data science, particularly network science and network analytics.
